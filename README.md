# ML Learning Journey – Heart Disease & Diabetes Prediction with XGBoost  
**Author:** Your Name  
**Date:** (Optional)  

This repository contains some of my **first ML projects**, following tutorials from the [Coursera Machine Learning Guided Project](https://coursera.org/share/4c06cda356a9e2d286030460ec852408). 
The goal was to learn **how to train classification models using XGBoost** and understand the basics of machine learning.  

## **Project Overview**  
This repository includes two early machine learning projects:
- **Heart Disease Prediction** (`cardio.ipynb`)
- **Diabetes Prediction** (`diabetes.ipynb`)

### **Key Learnings:**  
- How to preprocess data before training.
- How XGBoost works and why it's useful for classification.
- How to evaluate model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

## **Files in This Repo**  
- `cardio.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for heart disease prediction.
- `diabetes.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for diabetes prediction.
- `requirements.txt` – List of dependencies to run these notebooks.
- `LICENSE` – MIT License (optional but recommended).
- `.gitignore` – Prevents unnecessary files from being tracked.
- `datasets/` – Contains datasets used in the projects.

## **Datasets**  
The datasets used in these projects are stored in the `datasets/` directory:
- `cardio_train.csv` (Heart Disease Data)
- `diabetes.csv` (Diabetes Data)

These datasets are sourced from the coursera project.

## **Acknowledgments**  
These projects were based on **Coursera tutorials**, and I followed along to learn ML fundamentals. All credit for the original concept goes to the course instructors.

**Note:** These were my **first ML projects**, and my later work reflects more independent approaches with deeper analysis.
